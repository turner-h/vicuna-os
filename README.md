# vicuna-os

vicuna-os is an operating system project that I'm making because I'm bored. The intent of this project is to make something cool and learn about really low level stuff, not to actually make a high end user-viable OS.

## To do
- [ ] Preemtive multitasking via threads
- [ ] A more customizable bootloader (write one from scratch or break an existant one)
- [ ] Baby filesystem support

After these things I can start looking at user-space things.
